# Web-Scraping-using-Python
This project demonstrates the use of python to build a web scraping code that is a technique of extracting the information from the web pages.
It formats the unstructured data (HTML content) into a structured data (like a CSV file, excel spreadsheet, etc).

Beautiful Soup is used to implement web scraping, which is a python package for parsing HTML and XML content.

Project Gutenberg and IMDB websites are used for the demonstration.
